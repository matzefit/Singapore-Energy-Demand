# Singapore-Energy-Demand


3D Viewer for Cooling Energy Demand using 3D City Models of Singapore

I created this viewer to display Simulation Results calculated throughout my Master Thesis (2019 at SLA Singapore).
This viewer is based on CesiumJS and allows easy assessment of the Cooling Energy Demand of buildings in different time resolutions. Results have been calculated with the Simulation Environment [Simstadt](simstadt.eu).
